### Hi there 👋

I am a Lua and TypeScript front end developer for Interbyte Studios.

🔭 I am currently working on Science Simulator for Interbyte Studios and Tapping Gods for RussoPlays YouTube.
💬 If you're looking to reach me, the best possible way would be through my discord community. My DMs are off and will stay off for privacy, but I'm always active and respond to people publicly.
🌱 I'm always trying to learn new and innovative ways to program and improve my style. It's really embarrassing when somebody reviews your code and goes "wtf" like 50 times, so learning to keep up with modern development is a good way to avoid that 😄
